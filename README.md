# sentence [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nickb1080/sentence.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nickb1080/sentence)

Beautiful assertions for CoffeeScript. See the test file for examples.

Looks like this:

```coffeescript
expect(a) to equal b

expect(c) to exist

expect(d) to nt equal e

expect([]) to have length 0
```
